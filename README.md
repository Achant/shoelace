## Stage 2: Modify the Styles

____

Now it’s time to make it look good 😎. Make changes to the CSS (not the HTML) to apply your own styles to the design.

* [] Demo page demo.html shows components/elements with customized styles, including (but not limited to):

* [] A different typeface (take a look at Google Fonts for inspiration)
* [] A unique and different color palette (take a look at Adobe Color CC for inspiration)
* [] Style should be cohesive, connecting the elements as a whole. For example, a similar color palette is chosen.
